The Font Awesome fonts are designed by the
[Font Awesome project](https://fontawesome.com/)
and can be obtained from [here](https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-desktop).
**NOTE**:
All the following 3 fonts should be installed into the system:
* Font Awesome 5 Free
  (generic icons in regular style, much less than the solid style)
* Font Awesome 5 Free Solid
  (generic icons in solid style)
* Font Awesome 5 Free Brands
  (various brand icons)

  i.e., the following 3 OTF files are needed:
* `Font Awesome 5 Free-Regular-400.otf`
* `Font Awesome 5 Free-Solid-900.otf`
* `Font Awesome 5 Brands-Regular-400.otf`


Required Fonts
--------------
Besides the Font Awesome fonts, this template also requires the following
opensource fonts:

* [IBM Plex](https://github.com/IBM/plex) (Serif, Mono)

  Download the `OpenType.zip` archive from the
  [releases](https://github.com/IBM/plex/releases) page,
  and then extract the `IBM-Plex-Serif` and `IBM-Plex-Mono` directories
  and install them.

* [Source Han Serif](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-serif)

  The OTF font files for *Simplified Chinese* can be downloaded from
  [here](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-serif/tree/release/OTF/SimplifiedChinese).
  Just download all the weight variants:
  ExtraLight, Light, Regular, Medium, SemiBold, Bold, Heavy.

Of course, you can use the fonts you prefer by modifying the template directly.
However, you may need to tweak the column width accordingly.
